# Onboarding/Ingestion Server

This is the Onboarding Server for the Fleet of the Faithful Knights Monorepo.

The main purpose of this service is to act as an aggregator for other APIs' that we utilise. It is used in a way that allows us to pull data from external services and 'onboard' to one single data structure that is used within the FFK codebase.
