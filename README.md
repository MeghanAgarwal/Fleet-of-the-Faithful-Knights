# Fleet of the Faithful Knights

Fleet of the Faithful Knights (FFK) is a Star Citizen organisation that seeks to be a beacon of light in a dark universe.

This is the monorepo for the entire codebase that is mine. Thus far this consists of a Discord Bot, API and Voting Panel.

Almost all of the projects inside the repo will be written in/using a functional paradigm and as such you'll see usage of Option, Either, List, Set and Map data structures littered throughout the codebase.

I want to say that most of this stuff will just be plug and play but who knows, I might mess something up and break a thing or two.Pretty much just plug and play.
